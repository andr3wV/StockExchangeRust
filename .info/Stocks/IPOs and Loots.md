So when a company releases shares, let's say 1000 shares, with an IPO of $10.
These are bought in "loots", it's basically a group of shares.
e.g. 10 shares make a loot.

People will pay $100 for a loot, a single person can buy multiple loots though.

With this ratio, 100 loots exist.
But if 1000 people apply for 1 loot each.
So we need to compress 1000 loots into 100 loots.
I don't know who can up with this system, but..

Each loot depresses it's value and to fit the 1000 loots, each loot will provide 1 share.

SO BASICALLY YOU PAID $100 FOR A SINGLE SHARE, A SHARES WORTH $10
